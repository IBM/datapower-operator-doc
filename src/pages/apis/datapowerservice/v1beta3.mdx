## `license`

### Description

The `License` property contains three required fields:

- `accept`: must be boolean `true` for the DataPower pod(s) to start successfully. This property directly sets the DataPower `DATAPOWER_LICENSE_ACCEPT` environment variable in pods, which acknowledges the license acceptance.
- `use`: the license use. Can be one of the following values:
  - `production`
  - `nonproduction`
  - `developers`
  - `developers-limited`
- `license`: the license ID. For possible values, see [licenses](/guides/licenses).

The `license.use` is used in tandem with the `version` property to determine what DataPower firmware image to pull and use in the deployment, see [Image selection](/features/entitled-registry#image-selection).

<InlineNotification>

When deploying in IBM Cloud Pak for Integration, only the `production` or `nonproduction` values can be used.

</InlineNotification>

To view the full license terms, you can:

```
docker run --rm <image> --show-license
```

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  version: 10.0-lts
  license:
    accept: true
    use: production
    license: L-RJON-C44J3Y
  ...
```

## `version`

### Description

The `version` property specifies the desired DataPower firmware version to reconcile. This value must match an available version or channel the CRD and operator provide. Subscribing to a channel will allow for automatic updates to future versions on that channel. If the `DataPowerService` instance is created with a channel specified in `version`, the latest available version in that channel will be reconciled.

You are also able to lock in a specific version by specifying the full version string, for example `10.0.0.0`.

You can view the reconciled and available versions and channels on the `DataPowerService` instance's status, once created.

### Channels

#### Supported

The table below shows the **supported** channels for this CRD version (`v1beta3`) and operator version (`1.4.x`). Supported channels indicate channels which can be specified by `spec.version` for which this version of the DataPower Operator will understand and reconcile.

|Channel   |Stream    |Latest        |
|----------|----------|--------------|
|`10.0-lts`|`10.0.1.x`|`10.0.1.7`    |
|`10.0-cd` |`10.0.x.y`|`10.0.4.0sr1` |

#### Available

The table below shows the **available** channels for this CRD version (`v1beta3`) and operator version (`1.4.x`). Available channels (and version) are advertised in Cloud Pak for Integration as targets for operand upgrade. To enable and support the Cloud Pak for Integration EUS strategy, version `1.2.x` will only advertise EUS operand channels and versions.

|Channel   |Stream    |Latest        |
|----------|----------|--------------|
|`10.0-lts`|`10.0.1.x`|`10.0.1.7`    |
|`10.0-cd` |`10.0.x.y`|`10.0.4.0sr1` |

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  version: 10.0-cd
```

## `replicas`

### Description

The `replicas` property is an integer that directly sets the `replicas` field on the `StatefulSet` of DataPower pods. This property sets the number of DataPower pods you wish to deploy.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  replicas: 3
  ...
```

## `image`

### Description

The `image` property allows for a custom built DataPower Docker image to be used in the deployment. This field is optional, and will override the image that would be specified by `version` and `license.use`. The value of this property, if provided, will be directly used in the DataPower Pod specs.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If this field is set, you are responsible for setting the `version` property to the appropriate matching version that your custom image is based on. For example, if you are using a custom `image` based on `10.0.0.0`, then set `version` to `10.0.0.0`.

</InlineNotification>

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  image: my.registry.com/my-custom-datapower:v10
  version: 10.0.0.0
  ...
```

## `imagePullSecrets`

### Description

The `imagePullSecrets` property specifies the name(s) of Kubernetes `Secret` objects in the cluster which will provide the Docker registry credentials to pull any images needed during reconciliation and deployment. The Secrets must exist in the same namespace as the DataPowerService.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  imagePullSecrets:
  - datapower-cred-one
  - datapower-cred-two
  ...
```

<InlineNotification>

Note: If you do not specify the name of a Secret object, then the operator will look for one named `ibm-entitlement-key`. This is typically the method used to provide the Entitlement Key for pulling images from the IBM Entitled Registry. For more information, see [Entitled Registry](/features/entitled-registry#image-pull-secret).

</InlineNotification>

## `imagePullPolicy`

<InlineNotification>

Note: This property is only available in version `1.4.0` onward.

</InlineNotification>

### Description

The `imagePullPolicy` property specifies the image pull policy for the IBM DataPower Gateway image when the StatefulSet is created. Valid values are: `IfNotPresent`, `Always`, and `Never`. Default is `IfNotPresent`.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  ...
```

## `users`

### Description

The `users` property defines the user accounts to be created. The `name` field will be the name of the account and the `passwordSecret` field is the name of the secret that contains the credentials for the user account. The `access-level` and `group` property define the access-level, either `privileged` or `group-defined`, and the group, if access-level is `group-defined`. If using groups, it is expected that the configuration provided for the default domain would define the user group in RBM settings. This property does not create the group, it just creates a user asigned to the specified group.

An admin account must be defined. By default, an admin account is defined using the secret name `admin-credentials`. You can either create a secret with that name containing the credentials for the admin account, or use a different secret name by changing the `passwordSecret` field for the admin user in the CR.

The following are values in the secret which can be used to define the user's credentials:

- `password-hashed`: The hashed value (see Linux `man 3 crypt` for format) of the user's password. Required if `password` is not defined.
- `password`: The user's password. Required if `password-hashed` is not defined; ignored if `password-hashed` is defined.
- `salt`: The salt value used when hashing `password` (see `man 3 crypt`). Optional; ignored when `password-hashed` is defined. (Default: 12345678)
- `method`: The name of the hashing algorithm used to hash `password`. Valid options: md5, sha256. Optional; ignored when `password-hashed` is defined. (Default: md5)

The following examples create Secrets with different values, but result in an user with the same credentials (and the same password hash):

-  `kubectl create secret generic userName-credentials --from-literal=password=helloworld --from-literal=salt=12345678 --from-literal=method=md5`
-  `kubectl create secret generic userName-credentials --from-literal=password=helloworld`
-  `kubectl create secret generic userName-credentials --from-literal=password-hashed='$1$12345678$8.nskQfP4gQ8tk5xw6Wa8/'`

These two examples also result in Secrets with different values but identical user credentials

-  `kubectl create secret generic userName-credentials --from-literal=password=hunter2 --from-literal=salt=NaCl --from-literal=method=sha256`
-  `kubectl create secret generic userName-credentials --from-literal=password-hashed='$5$NaCl$aOrRVimQNvZ2ZLjnAyMvT3WgaUEXoWgwkgyBrhwIg04'`

    Notice that, when setting `password-hashed`, the value must be surrounded by single-quotes

For more information, read the Kubernetes documentation on [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets).

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  users:
  - name: admin
    passwordSecret: admin-credentials
    access-level: privileged
  - name: user1
    passwordSecret: user1-credentials
    accessLevel: group-defined
    group: group1
  - name: user2
    passwordSecret: user2-credentials
    accessLevel: group-defined
    group: group2
  ...
```

## `domains`

### Description

The `domains` property allows for user-provided domain configuration(s) to be injected into the DataPower pods at runtime, prior to the DataPower process starting.

For an in-depth look at utilizing this property, please see [Domain Configuration](/guides/domain-configuration).

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  domains:
  - name: "default"
    certs:
    - certType: "usrcerts"
      secret: "default-cert"
    - certType: "sharedcerts"
      secret: "shared-cert"
    dpApp:
      config:
      - "default-config"
      local:
      - "default-local"
  - name: "example"
    certs:
    - certType: "usrcerts"
      secret: "example-cert"
      subPath: "/example/path"
    dpApp:
      config:
      - "example-config-pt-0"
      - "example-config-pt-1"
      - "example-config-pt-2"
      local:
      - "example-local-pt-0"
      - "example-local-pt-1"
      - "example-local-pt-2"
  ...
```

## `env`

### Description

The `env` property allows you to set custom environment variables that will be set and used within the DataPower containers in the StatefulSet. This property exposes the Kubernetes API for declaring environment variables in the container, and thus follows the same schema. For more information, please see the Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/).

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  env:
  - name: DATAPOWER_LOG_LEVEL
    value: "7"
  ...
```

## `initCmds`

### Description

The `initCmds` property is an array of strings that represent initialization commands that you wish to run prior to the DataPower process starting. These commands will be run after the DataPower Operator internal initialization scripts, but before the DataPower `start.sh` script.

This property can be used in conjunction with the `extraExe` property to run custom initialization scripts that you've added to the DataPower pod(s), or any custom sidecar processes you wish to run in the DataPower containers.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  initCmds:
  - /usr/local/extra/test.sh
  - ls -al /opt/ibm/datapower/drouter/config
  ...
```

## `extraExe`

### Description

The `extraExe` property is an array of strings that represent name(s) of ConfigMaps in the cluster. When the DataPower pod(s) are created, the ConfigMaps specified by `extraExe` are mounted with `r+x` permissions at `/usr/local/extra`.

This property can be used in conjunction with the `initCmds` property to run custom initialization scripts that you've added to the DataPower pod(s), or any custom sidecar processes you wish to run in the DataPower containers.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  extraExe:
  - config-map-one
  - config-map-two
  - config-map-three
  ...
```

## `debug`

### Description

The `debug` property is a user toggleable debugging utility. If not set, it will default to `false`. For more information on the use of this property, see the [Init Scripts](/troubleshooting/init-scripts) troubleshooting guide.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

**Warning:** The `debug` property should only be set `true` if instructed by IBM Support.

</InlineNotification>

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  debug: true
```

## `resources`

### Description

The `resources` property specifies the desired resources to allocate to the DataPower containers in the StatefulSet.

### CPU

The CPU request must be specific in whole core count, but can take the form of an integer (`1`) or string (`1000m`) following [Kubernetes resource quantity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes) formatting.

The following constraints and defaults apply to CPU:

- Minimum cores requested must be `1` or `1000m`
- Partial CPU values (such as `1500m`) are **not** supported
- The default CPU request for nonproduction is `1` or `1000m`
- The default CPU request for production is `4` or `4000m`

It is worth noting that you can only request CPU, there is not a limit field, as the DataPower Operator will set:

```
DATAPOWER_WORKER_THREADS == container.limits.cpu == container.requests.cpu
```

Thus, when you define the CPU request, all of the above three values will get that value in the StatefulSet. This ensures best practices are followed in the DataPower runtime StatefulSet.

### Memory

You are able to set both requests and limits for memory. In both cases (`cpu` and `memory`) the values must follow Kubernetes formatting constraints.

If this field is not provided, or parts of the `resources` object are left unset, the example below shows the default value(s) that will be used (for a production deployment):

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 4
      memory: 4Gi
    limits:
      memory: 8Gi
  ...
```

## `livenessProbe`

### Description

The `livenessProbe` property allows you to set a custom Livensss Probe for the DataPower container(s) in the StatefulSet. The value of this property must be a well formed Kubernetes `Probe` type. If not specified, the following default will be used:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 3
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: 7879
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
  successThreshold: 1
  timeoutSeconds: 5
```

This default `livenessProbe` leverages the built-in DataPower health-check sidecar process.

### Example

In addition to the above example, it's worth reviewing Kubernetes documentation on [Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) for additional details on what configuration capabilities are available for this field.

## `readinessProbe`

### Description

The `readinessProbe` property allows you to set a custom Readiness Probe for the DataPower container(s) in the statefulset. The value of this property must be a well formed Kubernetes `Probe` type. If not specified, the following default will be used:

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 3
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: 7879
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
  successThreshold: 1
  timeoutSeconds: 5
```

This default `readinessProbe` leverages the built-in DataPower health-check sidecar process.

### Example

In addition to the above example, it's worth reviewing Kubernetes documentation on [Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) for additional details on what configuration capabilities are available for this field.

## `affinity`

### Description

`Affinity` is an interface for specifying custom affinity settings. This field is a literal `Affinity` object from the Kubernetes library, so it is fully featured and applies directly to the pods. When no Affinity is specified, the defaults shown in the example below are used.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
            - key: "beta.kubernetes.io/arch"
              operator: In
              values: ["amd64"]
    podAntiAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        podAffinityTerm:
          topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
          labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: datapower
              release: example-dpservice
```

## `storage`

### Description

The `Storage` property is a list of storage definitions. Storage definitions fall into two categories: ephermeral and persistent. For persistent storage definitions, the [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) must use an access mode of `ReadWriteOnce`.

The following fields can be modified:

- `type`
- `path`
- `size`
- `class`
- `volumeMode`
- `selector`
- `deleteClaim`

#### `type`

`type` defines the kind of storage volume that will be created. There are two valid options: `ephemeral` and `persistent`. Ephemeral storage takes the form of EmptyDir volumes mounted on `path`. Persistent storage takes the form of Persistent Volume Claims.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

Storage definitions of type `persistent` need to be decided and delcared at initial deployment time. Updates to the `storage` definition that modify (add, remove, update) `persistent` storage requests are not allowed, and will be rejected.

<br/>

If changes to `persistent` storage definitions must be made, the `DataPowerService` instance will need to be **deleted and recreated** with the new definitions. Note that deleting the `DataPowerService` instance will also delete the associated `StatefulSet`.

</InlineNotification>

#### `path`

`path` is simply the path internal to the container to persist. The `path` also informs the names of the volume resources to ensure uniqueness.

This field applies to both ephemeral and persistent types.

#### `size`

`size` is the size of the persisted volume. The expected format is some form of `#Gi`. For more information on resource definitions, see Kubernetes [Resources documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/scheduling/resources.md).

This field applies to both ephermeral and persistent types.

#### `class`

`class` is a direct pass through to the `storageClassName` field for the Persistent Volume Claim. It determines which class to use for the volume. See Kubernetes [StorageClass documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#class-1) for more details.

This field applies only to the persistent type.

#### `volumeMode`

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

This field is **deprecated** in `1.2.0`. If set to `Block` previously, the CR will be migrated to use `Filesystem` instead.

</InlineNotification>

If a value for `volumeMode` is provided, it will be overridden and set to `Filesystem` instead. See Kubernetes [VolumeMode documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#volume-modes) for more details.

This field applies only to the persistent type.

#### `selector`

`selector` is a set of label selectors to refine the search for a Persistent Volume to bind.

This field applies only to the persistent type.

#### `deleteClaim`

`deleteClaim` is a boolean value to specify whether a persistent volume claim should be deleted or retained.

This field applies only to the persistent type.

### Example

```yaml
storage:
- type: persistent
  path: /opt/ibm/datapower/drouter/config
  size: 10Gi
  class: some-storage-class
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      example.label: some.value
- type: ephemeral
  path: /opt/ibm/datapower/drouter/temporary
  size: 2Gi
```

## `podManagementPolicy`

### Description

The `podManagementPolicy` property maps directly to the StatefulSet PodManagementPolicy. There are two valid options: `Parallel` and `OrderedReady`. `Parallel`, the DataPowerService default, will make pods initially install in parallel to decrease time-to-ready. `OrderedReady` will make pods install sequentially, each waiting for the previous to become Ready before begining to install. For more information, read the Kubernetes documentation on [PodManagementPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#pod-management-policies).

### Example

```yaml
spec:
  podManagementPolicy: OrderedReady
```

## `serviceAccountName`

### Description

The `serviceAccountName` is a pass-through field for a Pod's ServiceAccountName. This field should be a string that is the name of the Service Account that is to be used by the deployed DataPower Pods.

If no value is provided, a minimal Service Account will be generated for use by the StatefulSet. The generated Service Account will also include reference to the `ibm-entitlement-key` image pull secret. For more information on this, see the [Entitled Registry](/features/entitled-registry) documentation.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  serviceAccountName: "example-serviceaccount"
```

## `odTracing`

### Description

The `odTracing` property contains the necessary information to enable OpenTracing and run an agent and collector containers. If `odTracing` is not defined, OpenTracing will be disabled by default. All of the required properties must be provided. It is recomended to only provide values for the agent and collector probes if instructed by IBM support. The agent and collector probes will default to recomended values shown in the example below when not included. If including custom probe settings, only properties that need to be changed have to be included. When going through the OpenTracing registration process, the secret that stores credentials should be named `icp4i-od-store-cred`.

Required:

- `enabled`
- `imagePullPolicy`
- `odTracingRegistrationHostname`
- `odTracingDataHostname`
- `imageAgent`
- `imageCollector`

Optional:

- `agent`
- `collector`

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  odTracing:
    enabled: true
    imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
    odTracingRegistrationHostname: icp4i-od.tracing.svc
    odTracingDataHostname: od-store-od.tracing.svc
    imageAgent: docker.io/ibmcom/icp4i_od_agent:1.0.0-amd64
    imageCollector: docker.io/ibmcom/icp4i_od_collector:1.0.0-amd64
    collector:
      livenessProbe:
        initialDelaySeconds: 8
        periodSeconds: 10
        timeoutSeconds: 2
        failureThreshold: 3
      readinessProbe:
        initialDelaySeconds: 10
        periodSeconds: 10
        timeoutSeconds: 2
        failureThreshold: 3
    agent:
      livenessProbe:
        initialDelaySeconds: 8
        periodSeconds: 10
        timeoutSeconds: 2
       failureThreshold: 3
      readinessProbe:
        initialDelaySeconds: 10
        periodSeconds: 10
        timeoutSeconds: 2
        failureThreshold: 3
  ...
```

## `jaegerTracing`

### Description

The `jaegerTracing` property contains the necessary information to configure and run a Jaeger Tracing agent sidecar container. By default, Jaeger Tracing is disabled. To enable Jaeger Tracing, the `jaegerTracing` property must be defined, with at least the `jaegerCollectorEndpoint` property specified.

Unlike the `odTracing` feature, `jaegerTracing` creates _only_ an agent container, not a collector. Thus, a Jaeger Collector must be configured independently, e.g., with the [Jaeger Operator](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/operator/).

Required:

- `jaegerCollectorEndpoint`

Optional:

- `agentImage`
- `agentLivenessProbe`
- `agentPullPolicy`
- `agentReadinessProbe`
- `samplingRate`
- `samplingType`
- `tls`

#### `jaegerCollectorEndpoint`

_**Required**_

The `jaegerCollectorEndpoint` property specifies the host and port for the Jaeger Collector's gRPC port. For example: `jaeger-collector-headless.cp4i.svc.cluster.local:14250`.


#### `agentImage`

_**Optional**_

Specifies the image to be used for the Jaeger Agent container. The default agent image is `jaegertracing/jaeger-agent:latest`.


#### `agentLivenessProbe`

_**Optional**_

Custom liveness probe settings for the Jaeger Agent container. Allows the following subset of typical liveness probe settings:

- `failureThreshold`
- `initialDelaySeconds`
- `periodSeconds`
- `timeoutSeconds`


#### `agentPullPolicy`

_**Optional**_

Pull policy for the Jaeger Agent container image. Defaults to `IfNotPresent`.


#### `agentReadinessProbe`

_**Optional**_

Custom readiness probe settings for the Jaeger Agent container. Allows the following subset of typical readiness probe settings:

- `failureThreshold`
- `initialDelaySeconds`
- `periodSeconds`
- `timeoutSeconds`


#### `samplingRate`

_**Optional**_

Sampling rate for Jaeger Client, based on sampling type.

The default value and valid values depends on the selected `samplingType`:

| `samplingType`    | Default `samplingRate` | Valid `samplingRate` values  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `remote`          | `0.001`                | 0 &le; `samplingRate` &le; 1 |
| `probabilistic`   | `0.001`                | 0 &le; `samplingRate` &le; 1 |
| `const`           | `0`                    | 0 or 1                       |
| `ratelimiting`    | `0`                    | `samplingRate` &ge; 0        |

 See [Client Sampling Configuration](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/sampling/#client-sampling-configuration) for details, where `samplingRate` corresponds with `sampler.param`.

#### `samplingType`

_**Optional**_

Type of sampling to use: `remote`, `const`, `ratelimiting`, or `probabilistic`. Default: `remote`.

See [Client Sampling Configuration](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/sampling/#client-sampling-configuration) for details, where `samplingType` corresponds with `sampler.type`.


#### `tls`

_**Optional**_

TLS configuration for the Jaeger Agent Reporter. By default, TLS with server host verification (using the system truststore) is enabled, though client authentication is disabled. See `--reporter.grpc.tls.*` under the [jaeger-agent CLI args](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/cli/#jaeger-agent) for details.

<InlineNotification>

While the `tls` property is optional, it will likely need to be configured to align with the Jaeger Collector's TLS configuration for the agent to be able to successfully connect to the collector. By default, TLS with host verification is enabled. In most cases, `tls.collectorEndpoint.secretName` may need to specify the name of a secret containing the Jaeger Collector TLS server certificate's issuing CA with filename `ca.crt`.

</InlineNotification>

The following properties are available for configuration:

- `disabled`

    _**Required.**_ When `true`, disables TLS between the Jaeger Agent Reporter and the Jaeger Collector Endpoint. Default: `false`

- `collectorEndpoint`

    _**Optional.**_ Credentials for validating the Jaeger Collector Endpoint's TLS server credentials. If Collector Endpoint server host verification is enabled (as is the default case), these credentials will likely need to be configured for connections to succeed.

    The following properties are available for the `collectorEndpoint`:

    - `secretName`

        _**Required.**_ Name of a secret with the Jaeger Collector's TLS server certificates issuing CA. The CA must be in a file named either `ca.crt` or `tls.crt`.

    - `serverName`

        _**Optional.**_ Specify the TLS server name we expect to find in the Collector Endpoint's TLS server certificate. <br/><br/>

- `reporterClientSecretName`

    _**Optional.**_ The name of the secret that stores the TLS client credentials used to identify the Jaeger Agent Reporter. If the Jaeger Collector is configured to authenticate TLS client connections, this secret will be necessary for connections to succeed.

- `skipHostVerify`

    _**Optional.**_ Disable Collector Endpoint server host verification. Default: `false`

    See `--reporter.grpc.tls.skip-host-verify` under [jaeger-agent CLI args](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/cli/#jaeger-agent).

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

Setting `skipHostVerify: true` is insecure and should only be used for testing in development environments.

</InlineNotification>

### Example

A typical configuration will likely be similiar to this:

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  jaegerTracing:
    jaegerCollectorEndpoint: jaeger-collector-headless.cp4i.svc.cluster.local:14250
    tls:
      collectorEndpoint:
        secretName: jaeger-collector-headless-tls
      disabled: false
```

## `annotations`

### Description

The `annotations` field serves as a pass-through for Pod annotations. Users can add any annotation to this field and have it apply to the Pod. The annotations here overwrite the default annotations if provided. For example, if the annotation `prometheus.io/scrape` was provided, it would overwrite our default value of `"true"`.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "false"
```

## `labels`

### Description

The `labels` field serves as a pass-through for Pod labels. Users can add any label to this field and have it apply to the Pod. The labels here overwrite the default labels if provided. For example, if the label `app.kubernetes.io/instance` was provided, it would overwrite our default value of `<cr.namespace>-<cr.name>`.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: "my-service"
```

## `tolerations`

### Description

The `Tolerations` field allows users to select which nodes DataPower Pods can be scheduled or not scheduled. By specifying a set of matching tolerations, users can control whether specific nodes can be used for scheduling DataPower Pods. In order for this to work, the corresponding nodes must have been tainted accoringly. For more information, please see the Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/).

### Example

The following tolerations allow DataPower Pods to be scheduled on nodes tainted with `host=dp:NoSchedule`.

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: "host"
    value: "db"
    operator: "Equal"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

## `nodeSelector`

### Description

The `NodeSelector` field allows users to specify a set of key value pair that must be matched against the node labels to decide whether DataPower Pods can be scheduled on that node. Only nodes matching all of these key value pairs in their labels will be selected for scheduling DataPower Pods. For more information, please see the Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/).

### Example

The following illustrates how to schedule DataPower Pods only on nodes labeled `hostType=gateway`.

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    hostType: gateway
```

## `lifecycle`

### Description

`lifecycle` allows scripts to be executed after starting and before stopping the DataPower container. For more details on container lifecycle hooks, please refer to the following Kubernetes documentation:

- [Container Lifecycle Hooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/)
- [Attach Handlers to Container Lifecycle Events](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/attach-handler-lifecycle-event/)

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  lifecycle:
    postStart:
      exec:
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo Hello from the postStart handler >> ~/lifecycle.log"]
    preStop:
      exec:
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo Hello from the preStop handler >> ~/lifecycle.log"]

```

### Delaying SIGTERM with preStop

When the DataPower container is terminated by Kubernetes under normal conditions (such as a scaling event or rolling update), any in-flight transactions may be terminated. The use of the `preStop` lifecycle hook can help to mitigate this by delaying the `SIGTERM` being sent to the container. For example, a 20 second delay in the below example would delay the shutdown by 20 seconds giving in-flight transactions on the gateway that much time to complete successfully before being terminated.

```yaml
spec:
  lifecycle:
    preStop:
      exec:
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 20"]
```

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

The `preStop` handler should complete within `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, which by default is 30 seconds. Otherwise it will not prevent the `TERM` signal being sent to the DataPower container. Thus it is not recommended to exceed `sleep 30`. See the Kubernetes documentation on [termination of Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination) for a deeper understanding of this lifecycle.

</InlineNotification>

## `podAutoScaling`

### Description

The `PodAutoScaling` has a group of fields to setup automatic scaling of DataPower pods. Users can enable either horizontal or vertical pod autoscaling and specify corresponding settings here.

### `method`

Method specifies the autoscaling method to be enabled. Since it is not possible to use both horizontal and vertical pod scaling simultaneously, one must pick either `HPA` (for horizontal scaling) or `VPA` (for vertical scaling) as scaling method. To disable pod autoscaling, specify `None` for method, or remove the `podAutoScaling` spec entirely.

<InlineNotification>

Prior to enabling `VPA`, ensure that the [installation prerequisites](/install/prereqs#optional:-vertical-pod-autoscaler) have been met.

</InlineNotification>

### `hpa`

`hpa` groups the fields used by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.

#### `targetCPUUtilizationPercentage`

When scaling horizontally on CPU usage, one can specify the target CPU utilization. This is represented as a percent value. For more details on how this value is used to calculate the number of pods, please see [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/).
When this value is set to 0, CPU usage will not be used as a metric for horizontal scaling.

#### `targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage`

When scaling horizontally on memory usage, this field specifies the target memory utilization for pods. This is represented as a percent value. Pods will be created or deleted when memory utilization exceeds or falls below this value.
When this value is set to 0, memory usage will not be used as a metric for horizontal scaling.

#### `maxReplicas`

This provides a ceiling on the total number of pods when scaling up. Horizontal pod autoscaler will stop adding new pods when this limit is reached.

#### `minReplicas`

This provides the floor on the total number of pods when scaling down. Horizontal pod autoscaler will stop removing pods once this count is reached. The value for `maxReplicas` must be greater than `minReplicas`. When omitted, default value of 1 is used. It is recommended to use the same value for both `replicas` and `minReplicas` but not necessary. `replicas` is used by HPA only for updating the desired number of pods while scaling up or down.

#### Example

The following illustrates how to enable horiontal pod autoscaling (HPA).

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  podAutoScaling:
    method: HPA
    hpa:
      targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 90
      targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 80
      maxReplicas: 6
      minReplicas: 1
```

### `vpa`

`vpa` groups the fields used by Vertical Pod Autoscaler.

#### `maxAllowedCPU`

When scaling vertically on CPU usage, this field provides the maximum limit for CPU that can be assigned to a pod. Vertical pod autoscaler will not increase the CPU limit for the pod beyond this value, even if current usage warrants it.
If this value is 0 or not specified, CPU will not be used as a metric for vertical scaling.

#### `maxAllowedMemory`

This field provides the maximum memory limit to be adhered when vertically scaling on memory. Vertical pod autoscaler will not increase the memory limit on a pod beyond this value even if workload requires more memory.
When this value is omitted or set to 0, memory will not be used as a metric for vertical scaling.

#### Example

The following illustrates how to use vertical pod autoscaling (VPA)

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  podAutoScaling:
    method: VPA
    vpa:
      maxAllowedCPU: 8
      maxAllowedMemory: 16Gi
```

## `runAsRoot`

<InlineNotification>

Note: This property is only available in version `1.4.0` onward.

</InlineNotification>

### Description

When `runAsRoot` is enabled (boolean `true`), the StatefulSet will be configured to run the DataPower containers as `root` user.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

If using OpenShift, a custom SecurityContextConstraint must be applied prior enabling this property. See [Running DataPower containers as root user](/guides/run-as-root) for more details.

</InlineNotification>

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example-dpservice
spec:
  runAsRoot: true
```

```

## Conditions

The `DataPowerService` supports Kubernetes [Conditions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#typical-status-properties). These `Conditions` can be viewed as a snapshot of the current and most up-to-date status of the `DataPowerService` instance.

- The `Pending` condition will be set `True` when the `DataPowerService` is first created and is reconciling the desired StatefulSet. Once the `StatefulSet` is created and `Ready`, this `Pending` condition will be removed.
- The `Ready` condition will be set `True` when all of the Pods in the StatefulSet are `Ready`, and the number of replicas in the StatefulSet matches the desired number of replicas set by the `DataPowerService` instance spec.
- The `Error` condition will be set `True` when an error is encountered during reconciliation of the `DataPowerService`. The `Reason` and `Message` should have details regarding what the error may have been, such as a referenced ConfigMap not being found.
- The `Warning` condition will be set `True` when a warning is generated during reconciliation of the `DataPowerService`. As with `Error`, the `Reason` and `Message` should provide details on the warning. An example warning would be that an update is available in the channel specified by `spec.version`, but the `spec.license.license` property has not been updated to reflect the new license.

## Custom Images

The `CustomImages` status property is a boolean flag that will be set `True` when a custom image (set via the `image` property in the CR spec) is being used.

## Managment Ports

The `MgmtPorts` status property is a list of management ports for the DataPowerService. Each item in the list will show the configured port for the respective management interface.

<InlineNotification>

Currently, only the `rest-mgmt` interface is supported.

</InlineNotification>

## Nodes

The `Nodes` status provides the list of DataPower Pods currently deployed via the StatefulSet.

## Phase

The `Phase` status property provides the current phase of the `DataPowerService`. The value can be one the following:

- `Pending` - There are no errors, but the `DataPowerService` is not yet `Ready`.
- `Running` - There are no errors, and the `DataPowerService` is `Ready`.
- `Failed` - There has been a `ReconcileError`.

## Versions

The `Versions` status provides information about the currently reconciled version of the operand (DataPower), as well as the available versions and channels the operator supports.

A channel, such as `10.0-lts`, allows for a user to subscribe to a stream of releases. When initially deployed with the `version` property in the CR spec set to a channel, the operator will automatically install the latest available version within that channel. When new versions are released in that channel, the operands (CR instances) will automatically be upgraded by the operator.

The currently reconciled version will always be available in `status.versions.reconciled`, even if the `version` specified in the CR spec is a channel.

### Licenses

The `Versions` status also includes license metadata for each version. This metadata is useful for understanding which license ID to use for `spec.license.license` when choosing a version to upgrade to, for example.

The below snippet shows an example of what this object looks like. Each DataPower version offers two different licenses. The value of `matchesCurrentType` indicates if that particular license matches the currently deployed operand (based on `spec.license.use`).

```yaml
