<PageDescription>

This guide provides steps to migrate an existing IBM DataPower Gateway (physical / virtual) to a container-based deployment utilizing the IBM DataPower Operator.

</PageDescription>

## Prepare for your migration

This guide assumes that you have already installed IBM DataPower Operator; if you have not, see [Getting Started](/getting-started).

Additionally, ensure that you have:

- working knowledge of our latest [`DataPowerService`](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta3) API version (`v1beta3`)
- familiarity with [Domain configuration](/guides/domain-configuration)

## Migrate

### Overview

</AnchorLinks>

### Backing up your existing IBM DataPower Gateway deployment

1. Log in to your existing IBM DataPower Gateway WebGUI as the `admin` user.
2. From the `default` domain, select **Export Configration** in the Control Panel.
3. Select either **Create a backup of one or more application domains** or **Create a backup of the entire system**, depending on how many domains you intend to migrate.
4. Follow the system prompts.
5. Once complete, download the backup ZIP.

### Generating ConfigMap YAMLs for application domains

1. Download the [`migrate-backup.sh`](https://github.com/IBM/datapower-operator-scripts#migrate-backupsh) script.

    This script is designed to automatically generate the ConfigMaps for each application domain from an IBM DataPower Gateway backup:

    - ConfigMap YAML for each domain `.cfg` file
    - ConfigMap YAML for each domain's `local:///` file system

    For details on the script's invocation, see `./migrate-backup.sh --help`.

2. Run the script against your backup ZIP.

    ```
    ./migrate-backup.sh backup.zip
    ```

    **Note:** If you only wish to migrate a single domain, specify the `-d` or `--domain` argument. For example:

    ```
    ./migrate-backup.sh --domain test backup.zip
    ```

3. Inspect the generated output for details on where output files are generated, for example,

    ```
    YAML will be generated in: backup-output
    ```

4. Review the generated YAML files.

    - Files ending in `-cfg.yaml` contain the domain's configuration in `cfg` format.
    - Files ending in `-local.yaml` contain the domain's `local:///` file system, in `.tar.gz` format.

    You apply the YAML (both formats) in the next step.

### Creating ConfigMaps in your Kuberetes / OpenShift cluster

In the appropriate Kubernetes namespace or OpenShift project, apply the generated YAML for each domain that you wish to migrate.

<InlineNotification>

The below examples use `oc` CLI as example (for OpenShift), Kubernetes users should substitue `kubectl` where appropriate, and make sure to use `-n namespace` to specify the target namespace for resource creation.

</InlineNotification>

**Note:** These ConfigMaps will be used later in [Building the DataPowerService resource spec](/migration/containers#building-the-datapowerservice-resource-spec).

1. (OpenShift only) Using your `oc` CLI, switch to the project (namespace) you wish to deploy the migrated IBM DataPower Gateway.

    ```
    oc project <namespace>
    ```

2. Apply the generated YAML files. Be sure to apply all YAML files for each domain you wish to migrate.

    Example of single domain with a `cfg` and `local` YAML each:

    ```bash
    cd backup-output
    oc apply -f domain-cfg.yaml
    oc apply -f domain-local.yaml
    ```

    Example using bash scripting to apply all YAMLs from the backup at once:

    ```bash
    for yaml in $(find backup-output -name '*.yaml'); do
        oc apply -f $yaml
    done
    ```

3. Once the YAML is applied, check the cluster to ensure that everything looks correct:

    ```
    oc get configmap
    ```

### Creating Secrets in your Kubernetes / OpenShift cluster

The TLS keys and certificates used by your IBM DataPower Gateway services must be stored in Kubernetes Secrets.

**Note:** These Secrets will be used later in [Building the DataPowerService resource spec](/migration/containers#building-the-datapowerservice-resource-spec).

1. Gather the keys and certificates you wish to use.

    <InlineNotification kind="warning">

    **Note:** You cannot export the private keys from an existing physical or virtual appliance.

    </InlineNotification>

2. For each key/cert pair or set of crypto, create a Secret with an appropriate name to reference later:

    ```
    oc create secret tls <my-tls-secret> --key=/path/to/my.crt --cert=/path/to/my.key
    ```

    or for generic (non-TLS) crypto:

    ```
    oc create secret generic <my-crypto-secret> --from-file=/path/to/cert --from-file=/path/to/key
    ```

    Refer to the Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) for details on the differences among Secrets.

### Creating an admin user credential

Following security best-practices, the IBM DataPower Gateway `admin` user credentials are stored in a Kubernetes Secret.

Create the Secret using `oc` (or `kubectl` for Kubernetes), specifying the password via CLI, and noting the name of the Secret as you will need this later:

```
oc create secret generic admin-credentials --from-literal=password=admin
```

Example: In the above command, `admin-credentials` is the name of the Secret, and `admin` is the password.

### Building the DataPowerService resource spec

<InlineNotification>

**Recommended:** Open our DataPowerService [API docs](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta3) for reference as you build your custom resource spec.

</InlineNotification>

1. Open your editor of choice, and start with the following template:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
    kind: DataPowerService
    metadata:
      name: migration-example
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      version: 10.0-cd
      license:
        accept: true
        use: production
        license: L-RJON-BYDR3Q
    ```

2. Edit the `spec.version` and `spec.license` to choose your desired firmware version and edition.

    - Refer to our [Licenses guide](/guides/licenses) for appropriate values for `spec.license.license` and how they map to the `spec.version` and `spec.license.use`.
    - Refer to the [`spec.license`](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta3#license) and [`spec.version`](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta3#version) API docs for details on these fields.


3. Add a `spec.users` definition for your `admin` user, using the Secret name (`admin-credentials`) created in the [Create an admin user credential](/migration/containers#creating-an-admin-user-credential) step for the value of `passwordSecret`. See the [`spec.users`](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta3#users) API docs for details.

    For example:

    ```yaml
    users:
    - name: admin
      accessLevel: privileged
      passwordSecret: admin-credentials
    ```

4. Add a `spec.domains` definition, with an entry for each application domain you wish to deploy.

    For reference, see the [Domain configuration guide](/guides/domain-configuration).

    As an example, let's assume a domain name of `example`. Let's also assume that we created `example-cfg` and `example-local` ConfigMaps for this domain, containing its configuration and `local:///` file system respectively. The `spec.domains` definition would be:

    ```yaml
    domains:
    - name: example
      dpApp:
        config:
        - example-cfg
        local:
        - example-local
    ```

    Next, update the domain object to include any [certs](/guides/domain-configuration#certs) definitions, referencing the Secrets you created in an earlier step containg TLS or other crypto material.

    As an example, let's assume we created a Secret named `example-service` which contains a TLS key/cert pair for a service defined in this `example` application domain. The amended domains spec would be:

    ```yaml
    domains:
    - name: example
      certs:
      - certType: usrcerts
        secret: example-service
      dpApp:
        config:
        - example-cfg
        local:
        - example-local
    ```

    Repeat the full procedure in this step for each application domain you wish to deploy.

5. You should now have a complete DataPowerService definition. Putting the above examples together would give us:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3
    kind: DataPowerService
    metadata:
      name: migration-example
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      version: 10.0-cd
      license:
        accept: true
        use: production
        license: L-RJON-BYDR3Q
      users:
      - name: admin
        accessLevel: privileged
        passwordSecret: admin-credentials
      domains:
      - name: example
        certs:
        - certType: usrcerts
          secret: example-service
        dpApp:
          config:
          - example-cfg
          local:
          - example-local
    ```

6. Save the YAML to a file of your choosing. For subsequent examples, we'll use `migration-example.yaml`.

### Deploying the DataPowerService resource

1. Create the DataPowerService resource in the cluster.

    ```
    oc apply -f migration-example.yaml
    ```

    For Kubernetes users, where `namespace` is your desired namespace:

    ```
    kubectl -n namespace -f migration-example.yaml
    ```

2. Check the status of the deployment to ensure successful migration.

    ```
    # full view
    oc get all

    # just the DataPowerService instance(s)
    oc get dp
    ```

    For Kubernetes users:

    ```
    # full view
    kubectl -n namespace get all

    # just the DataPowerService instance(s)
    kubectl -n namespace get dp
    ```

    Refer to our guide on [operand status](/guides/operand-status) for more information.

3. If the DataPowerService is operational and `Ready`, continue on to modernizing your IBM DataPower Gateway workloads.
