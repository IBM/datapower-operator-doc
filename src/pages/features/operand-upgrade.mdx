## Upgrade Strategy

The DataPower pods are managed by a StatefulSet, which is managed by the DataPower Operator. When any change is made to the `DataPowerService` Custom Resource (CR), the StatefulSet performs a rolling update to serialize the change across the pods. This same strategy is used to perform an upgrade, as the specified version of the DataPower operand is simply a property in the `DataPowerService` spec.

## Specifying a Version

One of the required fields of the `DataPowerService` spec is [version](/apis/datapowerservice/spec#version). This property will determine which version the operator reconciles, unless a custom image is provided via the [image](/apis/datapowerservice/spec#image) property.

If a custom `image` is provided, the exact `version` must also be specified to inform the operator of what base image version is being used.

### Manual Upgrades

To manually schedule the upgrade, an existing `DataPowerService` CR can be modified to specify a new `version`.

For example, let's assume `10.0.0.0` was the currently specified `version`, and `10.0.0.1` was available. To apply the CR change:

```
oc patch dp <name> -p '{"spec":{"version":"10.0.0.1"}}' --type=merge
```

This change could also be applied via `oc edit` or by `oc apply` with the appropriate YAML.

### Automatic Upgrades

The DataPower Operator supports automatically upgrading the DataPower pods when new versions are available. To subscribe to an upgrade channel, specify an available channel name as the `version` in the `DataPowerService` CR spec. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: DataPowerService
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  version: 10.0.0
```

In the above example, the DataPower Operator will automatically apply the latest version when the CR is created. When a new version becomes available within that channel (i.e. `10.0.0.x`), the operator will automatically reconcile the new version, using the same Upgrade Strategy as above (rolling update).

## Checking the Reconciled Version

The reconciled version of the `DataPowerService` will always represent the current version being used by the StatefulSet. If a channel is supplied in the `version` field, the reconciled version will reflect the chosen latest version within that channel. If a custom `image` is provided, the reconciled version will reflect the version specified in the `version` property, which is expected to match that of the `image`.

The reconciled version is available in the `DataPowerService` status at `status.versions.reconciled`. More on this topic [here](/apis/datapowerservice/status#versions).
