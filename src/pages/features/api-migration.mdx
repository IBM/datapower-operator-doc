As new CustomResourceDefinition API versions are released, the API migrations which occur on those boundaries will be documented here.

## Background

As we iterate on the DataPower Operator, add new functionality, etc. our APIs will invetibly change over time. Our APIs are described by our CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs), which have an `apiVersion` associated with them. Each version of a given CRD can have its own schema, and thus the functionality of a given CRD version can change over time.

For more information on the conversion webhook that makes these migrations possible, see our [Conversion webhook](/features/webhooks#conversion-webhook) documentation.

## v1beta2 migration

The release of `1.1.0` introduces a `v1beta2` API and a new `DataPowerMonitor` CustomResourceDefinition. When upgrading from `1.0.x` to `1.1.x` the following migrations will occur:

- Any existing `v1beta1` `DataPowerService` Custom Resources (CRs) will be converted to `v1beta2` CRs.
- The `dataPowerMonitor` spec from the `v1beta1` CR will be translated to an equivalent `v1beta2` `DataPowerMonitor` CR.
- If a `v1beta1` `DataPowerService` specified a **channel** in `spec.version` it will be converted according to the following rules:
  - `spec.version: 10.0.0` becomes `spec.version: 10.0-cd`
  - `spec.version: 10.0.1` becomes `spec.version: 10.0-lts`

## v1beta3 migration

The release of `1.3.0` introduces a `v1beta3` API for the `DataPowerService` CustomResourceDefinition. When upgrading from `1.2.x` to `1.3.x` the following migrations will occur:

- Any existing `v1beta2` `DataPowerService` instances will be converted to `v1beta3`.
- `spec.license.license` is a new **required** field in `v1beta3` of the `DataPowerService`, and as such will be automatically populated during migration.
- If upgrading from `1.2.x` and `spec.version` is set to `10.0-eus`, this will be migrated to `10.0-lts`. Note that this will incur no change to the DataPower operand runtime.
