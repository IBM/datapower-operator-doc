### Fixes

- Fix an issue where updating an `extraExe` ConfigMap does not trigger a rolling update of the DataPower StatefulSet.
- Fix an issue where the DataPowerService controller would attempt to modify an immutable field on the managed StatefulSet.
- Fix an issue where the DataPowerMonitor controller could leak an updater instance and continue trying to reconcile a CR which no longer exists.
- Fix an issue relating to the `icp4i-od-store-cred` Secret (used by [odTracing](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta3#odtracing)) which caused unnecessary rolling updates to the StatefulSet.
- Fix an issue relating to the defaulting of `imagePullPolicy` which caused unnecessary rolling updates to the StatefulSet.

## 1.4.3

- Fix an issue which caused the StatefulSet to perform a rolling update immediately after becoming `Ready`.
- The `developers-limited` DataPower image is now hosted on IBM Container Registry at `icr.io/integration/datapower/datapower-limited`.
- New `ibm-datapower-operator` CASE, see [Installation via CASE](/install/case) for details.
  - The `mirror-images` [action](/install/case#4.-mirror-images) now requires a `--groups` argument to specify which DataPower images to mirror.

## 1.4.1

- Add support for DataPower firmware version `10.0.1.4`, available in the `10.0-lts` [channel](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta3#channels).
- Fix issue related to GID / UID of DataPower pods when running on vanilla Kubernetes.

## 1.4.0

Starting with this release, all operator images are published to IBM Container Registry (`icr.io/cpopen`) instead of Dockerhub (`docker.io/ibmcom`).

### DataPowerService v1beta3 API

- Add support for IBM DataPower Gateway firmware version `10.0.3.0`.
- New property [`runAsRoot`](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta3#runAsRoot) that allows for DataPower containers to be run as `root` user.
- New property [`jaegerTracing`](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta3#jaegertracing) for use with external collectors.
- New property [`passphraseSecret`](/guides/domain-configuration#passphrasesecret) in the `domains` spec allows for `domain-settings` passphrase to be set, for `password-alias` decryption.
- New property [`imagePullPolicy`](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta3#imagepullpolicy) to set the IBM DataPower Gateway container's image pull policy.

### Platform

- Minimum Kubernetes version is now `1.19`.

## 1.3.1

- Add support for DataPower firmware version `10.0.1.3`, available in the `10.0-lts` [channel](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta3#channels).
- Fix split-cluster issue related to gateway-peering in API Connect Gateway deployments.

## 1.3.0

### v1beta3 API

This version brings a new `v1beta3` version of the `DataPowerService` CRD, adding the following capabilities:

- Horizontal and Vertical Pod Autoscaling
- Kubernetes container lifecycle hooks
- License acceptance enforcement during upgrade
- Pause reconciliation for troubleshooting

Upon upgrading to `1.3.0`, any `v1beta2` `DataPowerService` instances will automatically be [migrated](/features/api-migration#v1beta3-migration) to `v1beta3`.

Note that only the `DataPowerService` CRD has updated to `v1beta3`, the `DataPowerMonitor` CRD remains at `v1beta2`.

### Enhancements

- Conversion webhook management will automatically upgrade the conversion webhook runtime when necessary (such as upgrade from `1.2.x` to `1.3.x`).
- Stricter validation for minimum CPU and Memory allocations for DataPower containers.

### Changes

- Minimum CPU count for DataPower containers has been lowered to `1`.
  - The default CPU request for nonproduction containers is now `1`.
  - The default CPU request for production containers remains `4`.
- DataPowerService CPU request (`spec.resources.requests.cpu`) now supports [Kubernetes resource quantity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes) formatting.
  - This means that CPU can be requested using milli-CPU string, such as `4000m` for 4 cores.
  - Partial CPU values (such as `2500m` are **not** supported).

### Fixes

- Fix ordering of application domain config initialization during DataPower container startup.

## 1.1.1

- Fixes an issue relating to metering and licensing of DataPower Virtual Edition for Nonproduction, when deployed in IBM Cloud Pak for Integration.
- Fixes an issue relating to the `storage.size` property rendering in OCP Console UI, as well as IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Platform Navigator.
- Fixes an issue relating to the name generation and reconciliation of the `username-commands` ConfigMap created by the operator.
- Adds documentation `links` to the `ClusterServiceVersion` for both CRDs, as well as this documentation website.
- Conversion webhook management routine will now adopt orphaned webhook deployments if found during reconciliation.

## 1.1.0

### v1beta2 APIs

`1.1.0` introduces a new `v1beta2` API version, consisting of an **updated** [`DataPowerService`](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta2) CustomResourceDefition (CRD), and a **new** [`DataPowerMonitor`](/apis/datapowermonitor/v1beta2) CRD.

For more details on the (automatic) API migration process, see [API Migration](/features/api-migration).

With the new `v1beta2` API, the following changes have been made:

#### `DataPowerService`

- Removed `dataPowerMonitor` (replaced by `DataPowerMonitor` CRD).
- Added support for custom [`tolerations`](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta2#tolerations).
- Added support for custom [`nodeSelector`](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta2#nodeselector).
- Added `mgmtPorts` to Custom Resource `Status`.
- Changed the `version` [channel structure](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta2#available-channels).

#### `DataPowerMonitor`

See the API spec [here](/apis/datapowermonitor/v1beta2), and more information on the functionality [here](/features/monitor).

## 1.0.2

- Add support for DataPower firmware version `10.0.0.1`.
- Add support for DataPower Monitor version `1.0.1`.
- Add DataPower init script to clean `temporary:///config` on boot.

## 1.0.1

- Several changes and enhancements to support deployment via IBM Cloud Pak for Integration, including:
  - A minimal `ServiceAccount` is generated for use by the StatefulSet is none is provided in the `DataPowerService` Custom Resource spec.
  - Support for automatically using an `ibm-entitlement-key` Secret to pull images from the IBM Container Registry.
  - Labels and Annotations for Licensing and Metering of workloads, both standalone and within IBM Cloud Pak for Integration.
  - Kibana dashboard support.

## 1.0.0

Initial release.
