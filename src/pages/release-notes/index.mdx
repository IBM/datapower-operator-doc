## 1.2.3

- Add support for DataPower firmware version `10.0.1.3`, available in the `10.0-eus` and `10.0-lts` [channels](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta2#channels).
- Conversion webhook management will now upgrade conversion webhook Deployment as part of operator upgrade.
- Fix split-cluster issue related to gateway-peering in API Connect Gateway deployments.
- Fix reconciliation of `spec.labels` in `DataPowerService` custom resource instances.
- Fix `status.mgmtPorts` update behavior when StatefulSet is not `Ready`.
- Fix DataPower config initialization sequence and behavior.
- Fix an issue related to capital domain names.

## 1.3.0

### v1beta3 API

This version brings a new `v1beta3` version of the `DataPowerService` CRD, adding the following capabilities:

- Horizontal and Vertical Pod Autoscaling
- Kubernetes container lifecycle hooks
- License acceptance enforcement during upgrade
- Pause reconciliation for troubleshooting

Upon upgrading to `1.3.0`, any `v1beta2` `DataPowerService` instances will automatically be [migrated](/features/api-migration#v1beta3-migration) to `v1beta3`.

Note that only the `DataPowerService` CRD has updated to `v1beta3`, the `DataPowerMonitor` CRD remains at `v1beta2`.

### Enhancements

- Conversion webhook management will automatically upgrade the conversion webhook runtime when necessary (such as upgrade from `1.2.x` to `1.3.x`).
- Stricter validation for minimum CPU and Memory allocations for DataPower containers.

### Changes

- Minimum CPU count for DataPower containers has been lowered to `1`.
  - The default CPU request for nonproduction containers is now `1`.
  - The default CPU request for production containers remains `4`.
- DataPowerService CPU request (`spec.resources.requests.cpu`) now supports [Kubernetes resource quantity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes) formatting.
  - This means that CPU can be requested using milli-CPU string, such as `4000m` for 4 cores.
  - Partial CPU values (such as `2500m` are **not** supported).

### Fixes

- Fix ordering of application domain config initialization during DataPower container startup.

## 1.2.2

- Add support for DataPower firmware version `10.0.1.2`.
- Fix issue relating to `temporary:///` file system cleanup during DataPower pod initialization.
- Update Go to address CVEs: CVE-2020-28367, CVE-2020-28366, CVE-2020-28362.

## 1.2.1

- Fix Pod Topology Spread Constraints.
  - Set `topologyKey` to well-known "zone" label `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`.
  - Set `whenUnsatisfiable` to `ScheduleAnyway` to avoid blocked scheduling.

## 1.2.0

### Enhancements

- Add support for `datapower-cp4i` image, see [Image selection](/features/entitled-registry#image-selection) and [Cloud Pak for Integration: Gateway runtime](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS9H2Y_10.0/com.ibm.dp.doc/icp4i.html).
- Add support for DataPower version `10.0.1.1`.
- Add support for Cloud Pak for Integration 2020.4.1 EUS release.
- Pod scheduling errors are now raised as `Conditions` on the `DataPowerService` instance.

### Changes

- `DataPowerService` CR names are now limited to 52 characters.

### Deprecated

- `storage.volumeMode` is deprecated, and will now always be set to `Filesystem` for `persistent` storage requests.
  - If set to `Block` previously, the CR will be migrated to use `Filesystem` instead, automatically.

### Platform

- Minimum OCP version is now 4.6.
- Minimum Kubernetes version is now 1.17.

## 1.1.1

- Fixes an issue relating to metering and licensing of DataPower Virtual Edition for Nonproduction, when deployed in IBM Cloud Pak for Integration.
- Fixes an issue relating to the `storage.size` property rendering in OCP Console UI, as well as IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Platform Navigator.
- Fixes an issue relating to the name generation and reconciliation of the `username-commands` ConfigMap created by the operator.
- Adds documentation `links` to the `ClusterServiceVersion` for both CRDs, as well as this documentation website.
- Conversion webhook management routine will now adopt orphaned webhook deployments if found during reconciliation.

## 1.1.0

### v1beta2 APIs

`1.1.0` introduces a new `v1beta2` API version, consisting of an **updated** [`DataPowerService`](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta2) CustomResourceDefition (CRD), and a **new** [`DataPowerMonitor`](/apis/datapowermonitor/v1beta2) CRD.

For more details on the (automatic) API migration process, see [API Migration](/features/api-migration).

With the new `v1beta2` API, the following changes have been made:

#### `DataPowerService`

- Removed `dataPowerMonitor` (replaced by `DataPowerMonitor` CRD).
- Added support for custom [`tolerations`](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta2#tolerations).
- Added support for custom [`nodeSelector`](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta2#nodeselector).
- Added `mgmtPorts` to Custom Resource `Status`.
- Changed the `version` [channel structure](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta2#available-channels).

#### `DataPowerMonitor`

See the API spec [here](/apis/datapowermonitor/v1beta2), and more information on the functionality [here](/features/monitor).

## 1.0.2

- Add support for DataPower firmware version `10.0.0.1`.
- Add support for DataPower Monitor version `1.0.1`.
- Add DataPower init script to clean `temporary:///config` on boot.

## 1.0.1

- Several changes and enhancements to support deployment via IBM Cloud Pak for Integration, including:
  - A minimal `ServiceAccount` is generated for use by the StatefulSet is none is provided in the `DataPowerService` Custom Resource spec.
  - Support for automatically using an `ibm-entitlement-key` Secret to pull images from the IBM Container Registry.
  - Labels and Annotations for Licensing and Metering of workloads, both standalone and within IBM Cloud Pak for Integration.
