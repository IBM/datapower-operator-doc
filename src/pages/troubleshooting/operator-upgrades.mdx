If any known issues exist or migration paths are needed to upgrade from one version of the DataPower Operator to another, they will be documented here.

# 1.1.0

## Operator lock not released after Leader Pod removed

### Symptoms

- Immediately following an upgrade from 1.0.X to 1.1.X, you may see the following error when attempting to interact with a DataPowerService CR:
  ```
  Error from server: conversion webhook for datapower.ibm.com/v1beta1, Kind=DataPowerService failed: Post https://changeme.default.svc:443/?timeout=30s: service "changeme" not found
  ```
- Failure to reconcile changes made to a DataPowerService CR after a failover event caused the previous DataPower Operator Leader Pod to be rescheduled.

### Description

Occasionally, when the DataPower Operator Leader Pod is removed, the new DataPower Operator Pod will show as being Ready but isn't doing anything. In the logs you might see
```
{"level":"info","ts":"2020-09-08T19:29:53.432Z","logger":"leader","msg":"Not the leader. Waiting."}
{"level":"info","ts":"2020-09-08T19:29:57.971Z","logger":"leader","msg":"Leader pod has been deleted, waiting for garbage collection do remove the lock."}
```
followed by additional waiting. In this case, Kubernetes' garbage collection failed to clean up the `datapower-operator-lock` after the old Leader Pod was removed. This stops the new DataPower Operator Pod from completing initialization tasks such as creating the conversion webhook.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, you must manually remove the lock resource. This can be done with
```
kubectl delete cm datapower-operator-lock
```
Once the lock is removed, the new DataPower Operator pod will begin its initialization.

# 1.0.1

## Invalid value for `spec.selector`

When attempting to ugprade from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1` through the Operator Lifecycle Manager, an error will likely be seen that the `installPlan` failed.

```
install strategy failed: Deployment.apps "datapower-operator" is invalid: spec.selector: Invalid value: v1.LabelSelector{...}, MatchExpressions:[]v1.LabelSelectorRequirement(nil)}: field is immutable
```

This error occurs because between version `1.0.0` and `1.0.1` a new `label` was added to the DataPower Operator Deployment resource to fix an issue related to operator-metrics. However, the install plan is not able to resolve this update because the LabelSelector is an immutable field.

### Resolution

To workaround this issue, you can manually delete the existing `datapower-operator` Deployment resource. The Operator Lifecycle Manager should then recreate the `datapower-operator` Deployment resource with the `1.0.1` spec, and the install plan should succeed.

```
oc delete deployment datapower-operator
```

Once done, validate a new `datapower-operator` Deployment is created:

```
oc get deployment
```

Then validate the `1.0.1` install plan succeeds by checking the `ClusterServiceVersion` resource:

```
$ oc get csv
NAME                        DISPLAY                 VERSION   REPLACES                    PHASE
datapower-operator.v1.0.1   IBM DataPower Gateway   1.0.1     datapower-operator.v1.0.0   Succeeded
```
