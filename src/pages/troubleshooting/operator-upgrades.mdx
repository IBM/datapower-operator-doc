# 1.2.0

## Slow Kubernetes garbage collection can cause webhook service creation to fail

### Symptoms

An error may be seen that indicates a webhook `Service` is not found:

```
failed calling webhook "datapowerservices.defaulter.datapower.ibm.com": Post https://datapower-operator.default.svc:443/default-datapower-ibm-com-v1beta2-datapowerservice?timeout=2s: service "datapower-operator" not found
```

In the `datapower-operator` pod logs, the following log message is seen indicating the `Service` exists already:

```
{"level":"info","ts":"2020-10-06T20:32:45.818Z","logger":"setup-webhook","msg":"webhook service found. skip create"}
```

However, checking for the `Service` object (name `datapower-operator`) in the namespace would show it does not exist:

```
$ kubectl get svc datapower-operator
```

### Description

During the DataPower Operator boot the defaulting and validating webhooks are initialized. As part of this process, a `Service` object is created if not found in the cluster. If the Kubernetes garbage collection is slow or delayed it is possible for the `Service` object to have been marked for deletion, but still exist in the namespace for a span of time. If the new DataPower Operator pod attempts to initialize the new `Service` resource during this time window, the operator will continue through the boot sequence without creating a new `Service` instance.

Once the Kubernetes garbage collection catches up, and the `Service` is deleted, no `Service` will remain to expose the webhooks and thus API errors will be seen when invoking the webhooks.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, the DataPower Operator pod can be deleted manually. Once this is done, the Deployment's ReplicaSet controller will spin up a new DataPower Operator pod, which will in turn create the webhook `Service`.

1. Fetch the DataPower Operator pod, taking note of the name (will be the first column in the output).

    ```
    kubectl [-n namespace] get pod | grep datapower-operator
    ```

2. Delete the DataPower Operator pod, where `name` is the name of the pod found in Step 5.

    ```
    kubectl [-n namespace] delete pod/name
    ```

3. Validate a new pod is created in its place.

    ```
    kubectl [-n namespace] get pod | grep datapower-operator
    ```

# 1.1.0

## Operator lock not released after Leader Pod removed

### Symptoms

- Immediately following an upgrade from 1.0.X to 1.1.X, you may see the following error when attempting to interact with a DataPowerService CR:
  ```
  Error from server: conversion webhook for datapower.ibm.com/v1beta1, Kind=DataPowerService failed: Post https://changeme.default.svc:443/?timeout=30s: service "changeme" not found
  ```
- Failure to reconcile changes made to a DataPowerService CR after a failover event caused the previous DataPower Operator Leader Pod to be rescheduled.

### Description

Occasionally, when the DataPower Operator Leader Pod is removed, the new DataPower Operator Pod will show as being Ready but isn't doing anything. In the logs you might see
```
{"level":"info","ts":"2020-09-08T19:29:53.432Z","logger":"leader","msg":"Not the leader. Waiting."}
{"level":"info","ts":"2020-09-08T19:29:57.971Z","logger":"leader","msg":"Leader pod has been deleted, waiting for garbage collection do remove the lock."}
```
followed by additional waiting. In this case, Kubernetes' garbage collection failed to clean up the `datapower-operator-lock` after the old Leader Pod was removed. This stops the new DataPower Operator Pod from completing initialization tasks such as creating the conversion webhook.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, you must manually remove the lock resource. This can be done with
```
kubectl delete cm datapower-operator-lock
```
Once the lock is removed, the new DataPower Operator pod will begin its initialization.

# 1.0.1

## Invalid value for `spec.selector`

When attempting to ugprade from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1` through the Operator Lifecycle Manager, an error will likely be seen that the `installPlan` failed.

```
install strategy failed: Deployment.apps "datapower-operator" is invalid: spec.selector: Invalid value: v1.LabelSelector{...}, MatchExpressions:[]v1.LabelSelectorRequirement(nil)}: field is immutable
```

This error occurs because between version `1.0.0` and `1.0.1` a new `label` was added to the DataPower Operator Deployment resource to fix an issue related to operator-metrics. However, the install plan is not able to resolve this update because the LabelSelector is an immutable field.

### Resolution

To workaround this issue, you can manually delete the existing `datapower-operator` Deployment resource. The Operator Lifecycle Manager should then recreate the `datapower-operator` Deployment resource with the `1.0.1` spec, and the install plan should succeed.

```
oc delete deployment datapower-operator
```

Once done, validate a new `datapower-operator` Deployment is created:

```
oc get deployment
```

Then validate the `1.0.1` install plan succeeds by checking the `ClusterServiceVersion` resource:

```
$ oc get csv
NAME                        DISPLAY                 VERSION   REPLACES                    PHASE
datapower-operator.v1.0.1   IBM DataPower Gateway   1.0.1     datapower-operator.v1.0.0   Succeeded
```
