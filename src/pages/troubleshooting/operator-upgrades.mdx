# 1.0.1

## Invalid value for `spec.selector`

When attempting to ugprade from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1` through the Operator Lifecycle Manager, an error will likely be seen that the `installPlan` failed.

```
install strategy failed: Deployment.apps "datapower-operator" is invalid: spec.selector: Invalid value: v1.LabelSelector{...}, MatchExpressions:[]v1.LabelSelectorRequirement(nil)}: field is immutable
```

This error occurs because between version `1.0.0` and `1.0.1` a new `label` was added to the DataPower Operator Deployment resource to fix an issue related to operator-metrics. However, the install plan is not able to resolve this update because the LabelSelector is an immutable field.

### Resolution

To workaround this issue, you can manually delete the existing `datapower-operator` Deployment resource. The Operator Lifecycle Manager should then recreate the `datapower-operator` Deployment resource with the `1.0.1` spec, and the install plan should succeed.

```
oc delete deployment datapower-operator
```

Once done, validate a new `datapower-operator` Deployment is created:

```
oc get deployment
```

Then validate the `1.0.1` install plan succeeds by checking the `ClusterServiceVersion` resource:

```
$ oc get csv
NAME                        DISPLAY                 VERSION   REPLACES                    PHASE
datapower-operator.v1.0.1   IBM DataPower Gateway   1.0.1     datapower-operator.v1.0.0   Succeeded
```
