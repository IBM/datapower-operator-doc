<PageDescription>

The `DataPowerService` Custom Resource supports a range of custom status details that can help when troubleshooting issues.

## Retrieving DataPowerService status

You can interact with the `DataPowerService` resource type similarly to how you would a `Pod` or `Deployment`.

**Note:** The below examples use the `oc` CLI; however, the same commands should work with `kubectl`.

</InlineNotification>

```bash
# list DataPowerService instances
oc get DataPowerService

# describe one of them
oc describe DataPowerService/name
```

The `DataPowerService` also supports a shortname, `dp`:

```bash
# list DataPowerService instances
oc get dp

# describe one of them
oc describe dp/name
```

The `DataPowerService` is also listed in the following categories, allowing for it to show up in aggreggrated `get` output:

- `apic`
- `all`

To list these categories of resources use `oc get category` where `category` is one of the above.

## Understanding the output

The `get` output will show at a glance if the instance is `Ready`, how many replicas of the StatefulSet are `Ready`, and if there are any errors during reconciliation. For example:

```
$ oc get dp
NAME        READY   SUMMARY                           ERROR   AGE
dpservice   True    StatefulSet replicas ready: 3/3   n/a     17m
```

Similarly to other Kubernetes resources, you can `describe` the `DataPowerService` for more verbose status (as well as to see its spec). At the bottom of the `describe` output, you will find the `Status` section. This contains conditions and custom status entries.

To read more about the available information in the `Status` section, see [DataPowerService Status](/apis/datapowerservice/status).
