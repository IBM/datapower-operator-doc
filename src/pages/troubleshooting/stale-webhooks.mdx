description: Troubleshooting guide related to stale webhook configurations

<PageDescription>

The DataPower Operator implements and uses [Kubernetes Admission Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/) for validating and defaulting `DataPowerService` requests.

</PageDescription>

## Background

During the DataPower Operator pod's boot sequence, it will attempt to fetch and/or create several Kubernetes resources for the validating and defaulting webhooks. These resources include:

- `Secret` containing TLS key/cert for webhook API
- `Service` to expose the webhook API
- `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` for the defaulting webhook
- `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` for the validating webhook

The `Secret` and `Service` are owned by the DataPower Operator's `ReplicaSet`, and thus share the same life cycle as the operator pod itself. However, the two webhook configurations are cluster-scope resources, and are instead owned by the operator's `ClusterRole`. The expectation is that the `ClusterRole` shares the same life cycle as the DataPower Operator, but there are cases where this life cycle can be broken, leading to a mismatch between the TLS key/cert referenced by the configurations, and the TLS key/cert being used by the current operator pod.

## Problem determination

If you see errors relating to **bad certificate** or **x509 certificate validation** being logged in the DataPower Operator pod, you are most likely seeing this issue. Some examples are shown below to assist with problem determination.

```
2020/05/05 04:13:22 http: TLS handshake error from x.x.x.x:57076: remote error: tls: bad certificate
```

```
Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "datapowerservices.defaulter.datapower.ibm.com": Post https://datapower-operator.namespace.svc:443/default-datapower-ibm-com-v1beta1-datapowerservice?timeout=2s: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "crypto/rsa: verification error" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "datapower-operator-ca")
```

## Resolution

To recover from this state, both the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` and `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` configurations need to be manually deleted, and then recreated by the DataPower Operator. At a high-level, this process will be the following:

1. Delete stale `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` resource
2. Delete stale `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` resource
3. Delete `datapower-operator` Pod

When the `datapower-operator` Pod is deleted, it will automatically be recreated by the Deployment, and the newly created Pod will recreate the webhook configuration resources.

### Steps to Recover

1. Fetch the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` resource from the cluster, taking note of the name (will be the first column in the output).

    ```
    kubectl get MutatingWebhookConfiguration | grep datapower.ibm.com
    ```

    <InlineNotification>

    Note that if you are on a shared cluster, there may be multiple results from the above command, as there could be several instances of the DataPower Operator deployed across the cluster.

    </InlineNotification>

    If you need to filter down further, you can filter by the `namespace` you've deployed the DataPower Operator in. For example:

    ```
    kubectl get MutatingWebhookConfiguration | grep datapower.ibm.com | grep namespace
    ```

2. Delete the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` resource, where `name` is the name found in Step 1.

    ```
    kubectl delete MutatingWebhookConfiguration/name
    ```

3. Fetch the `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` resource from the cluster, taking note of the name (will be the first column in the output).

    ```
    kubectl get ValidatingWebhookConfiguration | grep datapower.ibm.com
    ```

    <InlineNotification>

    Note that if you are on a shared cluster, there may be multiple results from the above command, as there could be several instances of the DataPower Operator deployed across the cluster.

    </InlineNotification>

    If you need to filter down further, you can filter by the `namespace` you've deployed the DataPower Operator in. For example:

    ```
    kubectl get ValidatingWebhookConfiguration | grep datapower.ibm.com | grep namespace
    ```

4. Delete the `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` resource, where `name` is the name found in Step 3.

    ```
    kubectl delete ValidatingWebhookConfiguration/name
    ```

5. Fetch the DataPower Operator pod, taking note of the name (will be the first column in the output).

    ```
    kubectl [-n namespace] get pod | grep datapower-operator
    ```

6. Delete the DataPower Operator pod, where `name` is the name of the pod found in Step 5.

    ```
    kubectl [-n namespace] delete pod/name
    ```

The DataPower Operator's ReplicaSet will schedule a new Pod, which will create all the resources in the cluster again in a clean state.
