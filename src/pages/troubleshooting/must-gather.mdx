This page documents the steps for utilizing our MustGather script for gathering data necessary for troubleshooting issues.

</PageDescription>

## Getting the script

We maintain an open-source repository [IBM/datapower-operator-scripts](https://github.com/IBM/datapower-operator-scripts) on GitHub which contains useful scripts for working with or troubleshooting the DataPower Operator.

The `must-gather.sh` script is contained within this repository. To get the script, download an archive of the repository from GitHub, or clone it using the `git` or `gh` CLI.

```
gh repo clone IBM/datapower-operator-scripts
```

## Using the script

The `must-gather.sh` script will collect data from DataPower Operator deployment, and optionally a specified operand (`DataPowerService`) and its resources.

For detailed help information relating to the script itself, see its `./must-gather.sh --help` output.

<InlineNotification>

The `must-gather.sh` script relies on the `kubectl` CLI to communicate with the Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. You must have `kubectl` installed prior to running `must-gather.sh`.

### Gathering data from the operator only

The below example gathers data from a DataPower Operator deployment, without gathering any data from any deployed operands.

```
./must-gather.sh --namespace example
```

The output of this invocation would be a tarball in form `datapower-operator-must-gather.tar.gz`.

### Gathering data from the operator and operand

The below example gathers data from a DataPower Operator deployment, as well as a specific operand (`DataPowerService`).

```
./must-gather.sh --namespace example --datapowerservice my-operand
```

The output of this invocation would be a tarball in form `datapower-operator-my-operand-must-gather.tar.gz`.
