The DataPower Operator uses init scripts in the DataPower containers for various configuration management activities prior to starting the DataPower process.

## Debugging

To aid in troubleshooting of init script related issues, the `DataPowerService` offers a [debug](/apis/datapowerservice/spec#debug) property which enabled debug logging for these init scripts. When this property is set `true` it causes all DataPower Operator provided init scripts output debug level information.

**Warning:** The `debug` property should only be set `true` if instructed by IBM Support.

The output of the init scripts will be written to the container's `stdout`, which can then be retrieved using methods described in [Logging](/troubleshooting/logging#retrieving-logs).
