The logging level for the DataPower Operator can be adjusted to aid in troubleshooting issues.

</PageDescription>


## Log level

You can adjust the log level of the DataPower Operator Pod. The supported log levels are as follows:

- `error`
- `info`
- `debug`
- integer > 0

Notes:

  - Setting the log level to 1 is the equivalent of using `debug`
  - Setting the log level to an integer > 1 will increase the log level past `debug` for increased verbosity of operator code, as well as library code.
  - Setting the log level to an integer >= 4 will set the log level for Kubernetes API logging.

The mechanism by which you change the logging level may depend on how you installed the operator.

### Set via Helm chart

<!-- TODO: add link to Helm chart once published -->
Our Helm chart offers the `operator.logLevel` property as a method to change the log level.

### Set via Deployment

The DataPower Operator's `Deployment` can also be modified in the cluster directly. In the container spec you will see something like this:

```yaml
args:
  - "--zap-encoder=json"
  - "--zap-level=info"
  - "--zap-time-encoding=iso8601"
```

These values can be modified following the [default `zap` logger](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/golang/references/logging/#default-zap-logger) documentation.

## Retrieving logs

Logs can be retrieved from the DataPower Operator pod using `kubectl logs`, `oc logs`, or the OpenShift console if deployed on OpenShift.

Some examples, where `datapower-operator-777fccc85-68gs6` is the Pod name:

```bash
# dump all logs to file
oc logs datapower-operator-777fccc85-68gs6 > datapower-operator-logs.txt

# stream logs
oc logs -f datapower-operator-777fccc85-68gs6

# dump logs from previous container (i.e. after a restart)
oc logs --previous datapower-operator-777fccc85-68gs6
```
