## Container environment

### Supported platforms

The DataPower Operator currently supports:

- OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.6+
- Kubernetes 1.17+

### Worker node configuration

Installation of the DataPower Operator does not support adding Tolerations to the Operator Deployment resource out-of-the-box. To install properly, there must be one worker in the desired availability zone that is not tainted. If Tolerations are nonnegotiable, you can install the DataPower Operator using the [helm chart](https://github.com/IBM/datapower-operator-chart) and add the Tolerations to the Deployment template manually.

## Resource requirements

### Operator

The DataPower Operator's `Deployment` uses the following resource spec:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: 2
    memory: "2Gi"
```

For more information on what this spec means, see [Managing Resources for Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

### Operand

- The **minimum** resource requirements for a single DataPower container are 4 CPU and 4 GB of memory.
- For API Connect workloads, a minimum of 8 GB of memory is required per container.
- For production high-availability, a minimum of 3 replicas (one per node) are recommended.

## Cluster-scope permissions

The DataPower Operator requires the following cluster-scope permissions. These are brought in by a `ClusterRole` and bound to the operator's `ServiceAccount` via `ClusterRoleBinding`.

Permissions to manage CustomResourceDefinition defaulting and validating webhooks:
  - API Groups: `admissionregistration.k8s.io`
  - Resources: `mutatingwebhookconfigurations`, `validatingwebhookconfigurations`
  - Verbs: `create`, `delete`, `get`, `list`, `patch`, `update`, `watch`

Permissions needed for reconciliation of admission controllers (webhooks):
  - API Groups: `rbac.authorization.k8s.io`
  - Resources: `clusterroles`, `clusterrolebindings`
  - Verbs: `get`, `list`

Permissions needed for management of owned CustomResourceDefinitions:
  - API Groups: `apiextensions.k8s.io`
  - Resources: `customresourcedefinitions`
  - Verbs: `get`, `update`

Permissions needed for management of conversion webhook, which can exist in other namespaces:
  - API Groups: (none)
  - Resources: `namespaces`
  - Verbs: `get`, `list`

Permissions needed for management of conversion webhook, which can exist in other namespaces:
  - API Groups: (none)
  - Resources: `services`, `secrets`
  - Verbs: `create`, `delete`, `get`, `list`, `patch`, `update`, `watch`

Permissions needed for management of conversion webhook, which can exist in other namespaces:
  - API Groups: `apps`
  - Resources: `deployments`
  - Verbs: `create`, `delete`, `get`, `list`, `patch`, `update`, `watch`

Permissions needed for conversion webhook implementation across namespaces:
  - API Groups: `datapower.ibm.com`
  - Resources: `*`
  - Verbs: `create`, `delete`, `get`, `list`, `patch`, `update`, `watch`

Permissions needed for OCP platform related checks:
  - API Groups: `config.openshift.io`
  - Resources: `clusterversions`
  - Verbs: `get`

## Optional: PodSecurityPolicy

The DataPower Operator is expected to work as-is with the standard `restricted` PodSecurityPolicy; however, if you wish to leverage a more restrictive policy the following can be used.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: ibm-datapower-operator-restricted-psp
spec:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  forbiddenSysctls:
    - '*'
  hostNetwork: false
  hostPorts: false
  requiredDropCapabilities:
    - ALL
  runAsUser:
    rule: MustRunAsNonRoot
  seLinux:
    rule: RunAsAny
  volumes:
    - configMap
    - emptyDir
    - projected
    - secret
    - downwardAPI
    - persistentVolumeClaim
```

## Optional: SecurityContextConstraints

The DataPower Operator is expected to work as-is with the standard `restricted` SecurityContextConstraints; however, if you wish to leverage a more restrictive constraints the following can be used.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** This is only applicable to OpenShift (OCP) clusters.

</InlineNotification>

```yaml
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ibm-datapower-operator-scc
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: false
allowHostIPC: false
allowHostNetwork: false
allowHostPID: false
allowHostPorts: false
allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
allowPrivilegedContainer: false
allowedCapabilities: null
apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
defaultAddCapabilities: null
groups:
  - system:authenticated
priority: null
readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
requiredDropCapabilities:
  - ALL
runAsUser:
  type: MustRunAsNonRoot
seLinuxContext:
  type: RunAsAny
users: []
volumes:
  - configMap
  - downwardAPI
  - emptyDir
  - persistentVolumeClaim
  - projected
  - secret
```

## Optional: Multiple Failure Zones

The DataPower Operator `Deployment` is designed to pods evenly across multiple Kubernetes zones. To take advantage of this functionality, follow the [prerequisites](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-topology-spread-constraints/#prerequisites) for Pod Topology Spread Constraints.

With `EvenPodsSpread` enabled in the cluster, no more than one DataPower Operator pod will be deployed per zone. If `replicaCount` is higher than the number of available zones, the remaining replicas will not be scheduled.
