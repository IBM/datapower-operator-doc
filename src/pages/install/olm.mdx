<PageDescription>

The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) provides a framework for installing, updating, and managing the lifecycle of operators and their services.

## Prerequisites

The DataPower Operator currently supports installation via OLM in OCP clusters running version 4.6 or higher.

### Coexistence

When installing an operator via OLM, you have the option to choose its **Installation Mode**. There are two options:

- All namespaces on the cluster (`AllNamespaces`)
- A specific namespace on the cluster (`OwnNamespace`)

If installed in `AllNamespaces` mode, the Operator will use a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding and thus have cluster-wide scope to manage DataPower resources across all namespaces. If installed in `OwnNamespace` mode, the operator will use a Role and RoleBinding as its primary access (isolated to the namespace it's installed in), with a limited set of ClusterRole permissions (see [Cluster-scope permissions](/install/prereqs#cluster-scope-permissions)).

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

**Warning:** You should not install the Operator in more than one mode. If `AllNamespaces` is chosen, do not subsequently install a second instance in `OwnNamespace` mode.

**Warning:** If installing more than one instance of the Operator in `OwnNamespace` mode across multiple namespaces, they **MUST** be installed using the same channel / version.

## Installing the CatalogSource

To enable the installation of the DataPower Operator, a `CatalogSource` must be created in the `openshift-marketplace`.

The below YAML snippet can be used to create the `CatalogSource` resource, which references the `datapower-operator-catalog` image from IBM Container Registry. The use of the `latest` tag here will allow OLM to poll IBM Container Registry and pull new catalog images when they become available, enabling over-the-air updates.

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: ibm-datapower-operator-catalog
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  displayName: IBM DataPower Operator
  publisher: IBM
  sourceType: grpc
  image: icr.io/cpopen/datapower-operator-catalog:latest
  updateStrategy:
    registryPoll:
      interval: 45m
```

You can create this resource manually either via the OpenShift Console UI, or by using the `oc` CLI.

### Using the OpenShift Console

To creating this resource using the OpenShift Console, use the following steps.

1. Navigate to your OpenShift Console UI.
2. In the top-right of the UI, on the header bar, click the Import button `(+)` to import YAML.
3. Copy and paste the above YAML snippet into the editor.
4. Click the **Create** button to create the resource.

### Using the `oc` CLI

To create this resource using the `oc` CLI, use the following steps.

1. Create a YAML file containing the above YAML snippet.
2. Use the `oc apply` command to apply the YAML resource.

    ```
    oc apply -f ibm-datapower-operator-catalog.yaml
    ```

### Validating the CatalogSource is installed

To validate that the `CatalogSource` resource was installed correctly, use the following steps.

1. Navigate to the OpenShift Console UI.
2. On the left panel, expand the **Operators** section.
3. Select **OperatorHub**.
4. At the top of the OperatorHub section, enter `DataPower` into the Filter search box.
5. A tile should be shown titled **IBM DataPower Gateway**.

## Installing the DataPower Operator

To install an instance of the DataPower Operator, use the following steps.

1. Use the steps above to locate the **IBM DataPower Gateway** tile in the OperatorHub UI.
2. Select the **IBM DataPower Gateway** tile. A panel to the right should appear.
3. Click the **Install** button on the right panel.
4. Under **Installation Mode** select your desired installation mode.
5. Select the desired **Update Channel**.
6. Select the desired **Approval Strategy**.

    <InlineNotification>

    The Approval Strategy is what determines if the DataPower Operator will automatically update when new releases become available within the selected channel. If `Automatic` is selected, over-the-air updates will occur automatically as they become available. If `Manual` is selected, an administrator would need to approve each update as it becomes available through OLM.
