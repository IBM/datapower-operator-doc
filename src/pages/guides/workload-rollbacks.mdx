description: Guide to rolling back changes to DataPowerService Custom Resource instances

<PageDescription>

The DataPowerService uses a [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) to manage the DataPower Pods it deploys. We recommend versioning your Custom Resource YAML to enable rolling back changes you've deployed.

## Rolling Updates

The default update strategy for the StatefulSet is `RollingUpdate`. This ensures ordered and graceful deployment and scaling of the workload when changes are made. We recommend reading through the Kubernetes documentation on [Rolling Updates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#rolling-updates) to understand this concept in more detail.

## Versioning your Custom Resource

We recommend as a best practice that you should version control your `DataPowerService` Custom Resource YAMLs. Using a version control system such as `git`, you can easily revert changes you make to your configurations.

## Rolling back a change

To roll back a given change, the process is as follows:

1. Revert to the desired configuration using version control system, such as `git`.

2. Apply change using `oc apply` or `kubectl apply` with desired YAML.

### Example

```
# apply change
oc apply -f my-config.yaml

# check status, find that deployment is unstable
oc describe dp/my-resource

# decide to roll back the change, revert yaml locally using version control
# this can be accomplished a number a ways, some examples are:
git revert <last-commit>
git checkout <stable-tag>

# apply working yaml to roll back changes
oc apply -f my-config.yaml
```

## Forced Rollback

If a change is applied to the `DataPowerService` Custom Resource that puts the StatefulSet into a failed state, in which a rolling update does not complete successfully, you may need to perform a [Forced Rollback](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#forced-rollback) to recover.
