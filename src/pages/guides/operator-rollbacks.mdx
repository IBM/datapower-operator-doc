## Operand compatibility

Prior to rolling back (downgrading) an operator installation, any DataPower operands (`DataPowerService` custom resources) currently being managed by the operator must be made compatible with the desired (lower) version of the operator. One main consideration here should be the `spec.version` of the `DataPowerService` operand, as the supported values for this field gnerally may change between operator versions. As an example, operator version `1.2.0` adds support for `spec.version: 10.0.1.1`.

Thus, if an operator is running `1.2.0` and reconciles a DataPower operand with `spec.version: 10.0.1.1`, the operand must be downgraded to `10.0.1.0` prior to rolling the operator back to `1.1.x` (where `10.0.1.0` is the highest version `1.1.x` supports).

To modify the operand, edit any `DataPowerService` custom resources (CRs) and change the value of `spec.version` (and any other applicable configurations) such that the CR is compatible with the desired lower operator version.

## Rollback via OLM

To rollback (downgrade) an operator installation that is managed by OLM, the operator must be **reinstalled** as OLM does not support downgrading operators.

### Example

Given:

- You have a DataPower Operator installed, with channel `v1.2-eus` selected with an `Automatic` subscription.
- You wish to rollback (downgrade) to `v1.1` with an `Automatic` subscription.

Flow:

1. Edit applicable `DataPowerService` CRs to ensure compatibility with `v1.1` operator.
2. Delete the `v1.2-eus` subscription / installation, leaving any operands deployed in the namespace.
3. Create a new `v1.1` subscription, triggering the new installation.

## Rollback via Helm

To rollback (downgrade) an operator installation that was deployed using our Helm chart, the `helm rollback` command can be used.

### Example

Given:

- You have a DataPower Operator installed, at version `1.2.0`, which was upgraded from `1.1.1`.
- You wish to rollback (downgrade) to `1.1.1`.

Flow:

1. Edit applicable `DataPowerService` CRs to ensure compatibility with `1.1.1` operator.
2. Check revision history via `helm history`.
    
    ```
    $ helm history datapower-operator
    REVISION        UPDATED                         STATUS          CHART                           APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
    1               Mon Dec  7 14:23:56 2020        superseded      datapower-operator-1.1.1        1.1.1           Install complete
    2               Mon Dec  7 14:24:23 2020        deployed        datapower-operator-1.2.0        1.2.0           Upgrade complete
    ```

3. Perform the rollback, using appropriate `REVISION` number.

    ```
    $ helm rollback datapower-operator 1
    Rollback was a success! Happy Helming!
    ```
