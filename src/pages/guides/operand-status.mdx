<PageDescription>

Once deployed, an operand's status is available via the Custom Resources that compose the workload.

</PageDescription>

## Operand Custom Resources

The DataPower Operator manages **operands**, e.g. IBM DataPower Gateway pods, through its Custom Resources. The primary Custom Resource is the `DataPowerService` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD). When a `DataPowerService` instance is created, the DataPower Operator will keep its `Status` up-to-date. This `Status` can contain valuable information regarding the workload's state, including the status of an update rollout, any errors during reconciliation, etc.

While the `DataPowerService` instance is the primary instance for checking the status of the IBM DataPower Gateway deployment, the `DataPowerMonitor` instance is also a valuable component. For more details, see [DataPower Monitor](/features/monitor).

## Retrieving status

### DataPowerService

You can interact with the `DataPowerService` resource type similarly to how you would a `Pod` or `Deployment`.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The below examples use the `oc` CLI; however, the same commands should work with `kubectl`.

</InlineNotification>

```bash
# list DataPowerService instances
oc get datapowerservice

# describe one of them
oc describe datapowerservice/name
```

The `DataPowerService` also supports a shortname, `dp`:

```bash
# list DataPowerService instances
oc get dp

# describe one of them
oc describe dp/name
```

### DataPowerMonitor

You can interact with the `DataPowerMonitor` resource type similarly to the `DataPowerService`.

```bash
# list DataPowerMonitor instances
oc get datapowermonitor

# describe one of them
oc describe datapowermonitor/name
```

The `DataPowerMonitor` also supports a shortname, `dpm`:

```bash
# list DataPowerMonitor instances
oc get dpm

# describe one of them
oc describe dpm/name
```

### Categories

All CRDs that the DataPower Operator manages will be included in the following categories, allowing for it to show up in aggregated `get` output:

- `all`
- `apic`
- `cp4i`
- `integration`

To list these categories of resources use `oc get category` where `category` is one of the above.

```bash
oc get all
oc get apic
oc get cp4i
oc get integration
```

## Understanding the output

The output from `oc get dp` will show at a glance if the IBM DataPower Gateway instance(s) are `Ready`. For example:

```
$ oc get dp
NAME        PHASE     READY   SUMMARY                           VERSION    AGE
example     Running   True    StatefulSet replicas ready: 3/3   10.0.1.0   171m
```

Similarly to other Kubernetes resources, you can `describe` the custom resource for more verbose status (as well as to see its `spec`). At the bottom of the `describe` output, you will find the `Status` section. This contains conditions and other custom status entries.

To read more about the available information in the `Status` sections for each CRD, see:

- [DataPowerMonitor Status](/apis/datapowermonitor/v1beta2#status)
